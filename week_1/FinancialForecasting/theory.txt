1. Understand Recursive Algorithms:

--> Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
    Recursion is a method where a function calls itself.

    ex: real case- climbing 100 stairs. This includes making one step, and repeating this step till you reach the goal. 
        which means you are calling the same action again and again.

4.	Analysis:

--> Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
    Time complexity of a recursive algoritm is O(n) because it makes n recursive calls to reach the goal/base case.

--> Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
    The current has no overlapping problems or iteration problems.
